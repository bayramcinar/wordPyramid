# wordPyramid
In this project, I made my first game by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I called it WORD PYRAMID. You must find the three words. One of them is 5 letters, another one is 4 letters and the last one is 3 letters. There is a matrix in the game that includes the letters that do not include the first letters. There is a point area in the game. You will get points according to the words which are you find. Also, there is a time. You must find 3 words in 1 min. In this project, I learned drop and drag in JavaScript.
